Smart Memory Defragmentation System

Overview
-The Smart Memory Defragmentation System is a Python-based simulation of operating system memory management. It demonstrates how memory allocation, fragmentation, and defragmentation work, using both traditional techniques and an AI-assisted allocation strategy.

Objectives :
-Simulate fixed-size memory block allocation
-Analyze memory fragmentation
-Apply AI-based smart allocation
-Perform memory defragmentation
-Visualize memory usage and performance

Key Features
-Smart Allocation using AI prediction
-Real-time file monitoring for memory events
-Memory block display in terminal
-Defragmentation to reduce fragmentation
-Workload simulation (alternating, increasing, random)
-Performance analysis and 3D visualization

Technologies Used
-Python 3.12
-NumPy
-scikit-learn
-Watchdog
-Matplotlib


Analysis
-The system shows that smart allocation reduces fragmentation compared to naive allocation. Defragmentation significantly improves memory utilization, especially after random workloads. AI prediction improves allocation decisions as more data is collected.

Conclusion
-This project effectively demonstrates core operating system memory management concepts. By combining simulation, AI-based decision making, and visualization, it provides a clear understanding of fragmentation, allocation strategies, and defragmentation techniques.
