1.The visualization window (memory blocks before and after defragmentation) will pop up.

"This is our main program, main.py, which simulates memory allocation and defragmentation."
ðŸ”¹ Explain the graphs:

"This first graph shows the memory state before defragmentation."
"Here, we see which blocks are allocated (1) and which are free (0)."
"After running the defragmentation algorithm, the second graph shows the memory state after all allocated blocks are moved left."
ðŸ”¹ Explain the Terminal Output:

"The terminal prints the loaded memory state and the predicted next free memory index."
"If memory is full or fragmented, it helps determine where the next block should be allocated."
ðŸ”¹ Show a Practical Example:

"We can manually add/remove files in MemoryBlocks/, rerun the program, and see the memory adjust dynamically."




 2.Show Test Cases Passing (tests/test_memory.py):

ðŸ”¹ What is a Test Case?
A test case is a small program that checks whether different parts of your code work correctly.
You likely wrote (or need to write) test_memory.py, which contains functions to test:

Memory Allocation â€“ Ensures memory blocks are assigned correctly.
Defragmentation â€“ Verifies that defragmentation moves allocated blocks to the left.
When you run pytest, it automatically executes these tests.

ðŸ”¹ How to Explain This to Your Professor?
Relate this to Step 3: Show Test Cases Passing:

Purpose:
"We wrote automated test cases to check if our memory allocation and defragmentation logic is correct."
What the Output Means:
"Two tests ran (test_memory.py ..), and both passed (100%). This proves our implementation is correct."
Show Code (Optional):
Open test_memory.py and explain what each test is checking.
